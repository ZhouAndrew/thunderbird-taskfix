# CalDAV Assistant Experimental 0.3.7 — simple program boundary

The design goal is deliberately ordinary: a small UI, a set of plain functions, a few plain objects, strict read-back checks, and persistent logs.

## Work

`workspace.html + workspace.js` only does this:

existing Task -> select -> Start -> Working -> Pause/Resume -> Complete or Cancel

Rules:

- the Work page defaults to the Incomplete view;
- completed/cancelled Tasks remain available through explicit views instead of being deleted;
- the Work page may temporarily switch view/Calendar without changing persistent defaults;
- the Work page never creates a Task;
- before a Task is selected there are no workflow buttons;
- only actions valid for the current state are shown;
- completed/cancelled Tasks show no workflow buttons;
- UID, raw VTODO status, Work Calendar, provider IDs and JSON details do not appear on the Work page;
- the Work page keeps only a short human-readable recent result.

## Plain action functions

`core/executor.js` is intentionally a file of plain functions. It does not define a class hierarchy or workflow framework.

The public operations are:

- `start(task, workCalendarId)`
- `pause(task)`
- `resume(task, workCalendarId)`
- `complete(task)`
- `cancel(task)`

Data-changing paths use:

write -> read back -> compare -> Result

Start/Resume create Work VEVENTs. Pause/Complete/Cancel close the current Work VEVENT. Rollback code exists only where a partial remote write could otherwise leave inconsistent data.

## Small data objects

Runtime data is ordinary JavaScript objects:

- Task view
- Work event reference
- Runtime state
- Result/receipt
- Settings

There is no domain class hierarchy.

## Logging rule

Every user-visible success/failure result is sent to `AssistantStorage.persistResult()` before the function returns it to the UI.

That function attempts:

Result -> append persistent audit -> cache latest Result -> return to UI

If the persistent audit write fails, `logSaved=false` and the UI must say so instead of pretending the result was safely logged.

The Logs page owns full technical detail. The Work page only shows a short result plus a link to Logs.

## Guided defaults and Tools

`tools.html` owns settings and connection tests.

The default Task view and default Task Calendar are ordinary `browser.storage.local` settings. The Calendar value is Thunderbird's existing Calendar id; the add-on does not maintain a second Calendar registry.

Saving those defaults writes one settings undo snapshot. Undo restores the previous Assistant settings object. If a configured Task Calendar disappears, Work temporarily shows All Calendars and links the user back to Tools; it never silently replaces the saved preference.

A missing Work Calendar may be inferred for one workflow action, but that inferred choice is not persisted automatically.


Calendar full test:

temporary TEST VEVENT -> read -> update -> read -> delete -> verify absence

It never creates a VTODO.

WordPress full test:

temporary Draft Post -> read -> update -> read -> temporary media -> read -> delete media -> delete post

## WordPress

`record.html` is an append-only daily log UI. It has no per-entry title or post-status fields.

Normal Record flow:

today's exact daily title -> find published post -> create it only if absent -> upload optional media to that post -> append one Gutenberg log entry -> read back and verify marker

For example, the daily post title can be `October 1 Thursday 2026`. Multiple Record submissions on the same day reuse the same Post ID. Attachments are parented to that daily post and linked from the appended entry.

The visible result reports the daily Post ID / Media ID values; the full request/result record stays in Logs. Completing a Task still does not implicitly create a WordPress post.

## Data ownership

- Thunderbird/CalDAV = Task and Event facts.
- browser.storage.local = small Assistant runtime/settings/audit state only.
- WordPress = explicit long-form records.

## Top-level UI

Exactly five ordinary pages:

Work | Today | Record | Logs | Tools

The internal implementation may have supporting files, but those are not additional user workflows.
